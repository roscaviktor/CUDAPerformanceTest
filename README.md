 This application generate an image using CUDA. 
 CUDA is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model created by NVIDIA.
 It allows software developers to use a CUDA-enabled graphics processing unit (GPU) for general purpose 
 processing – an approach known as GPGPU. The CUDA platform is a software layer that gives direct access 
 to the GPU's virtual instruction set and parallel computational elements.
